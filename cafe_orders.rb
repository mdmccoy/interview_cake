# My cake shop is so popular, I'm adding some tables and hiring wait staff so folks can have a cute sit-down cake-eating experience.

# I have two registers: one for take-out orders, and the other for the other folks eating inside the cafe. All the customer orders get combined into one list for the kitchen, where they should be handled first-come, first-served.

# Recently, some customers have been complaining that people who placed orders after them are getting their food first. Yikesâ€”that's not good for business!

# To investigate their claims, one afternoon I sat behind the registers with my laptop and recorded:

#     The take-out orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (take_out_orders)
#     The dine-in orders as they were entered into the system and given to the kitchen. (dine_in_orders)
#     Each customer order (from either register) as it was finished by the kitchen. (served_orders)

# Given all three arrays, write a method to check that my service is first-come, first-served. All food should come out in the same order customers requested it.

# We'll represent each customer order as a unique integer.

# As an example,

#   Take Out Orders: [1, 3, 5]
#  Dine In Orders: [2, 4, 6]
#   Served Orders: [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 3]

# would not be first-come, first-served, since order 3 was requested before order 5 but order 5 was served first.

# But,

#   Take Out Orders: [17, 8, 24]
#  Dine In Orders: [12, 19, 2]
#   Served Orders: [17, 8, 12, 19, 24, 2]

# would be first-come, first-served.
# 
def first_come_first_served?(take_out_orders, dine_in_orders, served_orders)
  # This solution is O(n) time and O(n) space as we create two copies of served_orders and then subtract our orders from them.
  # Subtracting two arrays iterates through 

  return false if take_out_orders.size + dine_in_orders.size != served_orders.size

  dine_in_in_order = (served_orders - take_out_orders) == dine_in_orders
  take_out_in_order = (served_orders - dine_in_orders) == take_out_orders

  dine_in_in_order && take_out_in_order
end

# Based on my tests, this would be O(1) size because it does not allocate any additional memory
# def first_come_first_served?(take_out_orders, dine_in_orders, served_orders)
#   return false if take_out_orders.size + dine_in_orders.size != served_orders.size

#   # Go through served_orders, checking each served_order is the next order in either array.
